# Out-Station Performance Dashboard

Analyzed and visualized Out-Station performance data by integrating multiple sources, cleaning and transforming them to perform OLAP operations (Roll-Up, Slicing and Dicing) to obtain KPIs and improve business strategy. This helped to do comparative performance analysis of the out stations and identify loopholes. Data-driven decisions were taken, resulting in a remarkable increase in overall revenue by increasing the passenger ratio and carriage of excess baggage and cargo.
